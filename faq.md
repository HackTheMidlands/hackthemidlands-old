# What if I don't know how to code?
That is not a problem! A great way to learn how to code is by attending a hackathon. It's an event for like-minded people to share what they are interested in and teach each-other what they are passionate about, whether its coding, electronics or anything else you want to know about. You never know what new skill you might pick up! You can also ask specific questions to our mentors and in the Discord server, where people are there to help.

# I don't have a team
Don't worry! Many people don't have a team when they turn up to a hackathon. You will be able to meet people and network before the hacking begins, and we also have our Discord server where people are looking for teams and teams are looking for members.

We will be following the Hack Code of Conduct, which can be found [here](http://hackcodeofconduct.org/).
